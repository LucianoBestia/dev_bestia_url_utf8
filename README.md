## Motivation

Urls must be constantly encoded and decoded.  
It deserves something short like the macro `url!("x/y/{}", name)`.  
This module is strictly limited to utf8 urls.  
Url is made of parts, fragments or segments mostly delimited by slash "/".  
They must be separately encoded/decoded, not as a whole url string.  
It is impossible to guarantee that the whole string is correctly encoded/decoded.  
But is possible to minimize the misuse of the String type for Url.  
With the normal String it is not possible to force the developer to encode/decode.  
With special wrapper types around String is possible to help the coder to write properly and not forget about it.  
TODO: analyze if is possible to use more &str and Cow instead of always allocating String.  
But urls are usually small and this is not a priority.  

## Development

I use [cargo-auto](https://crates.io/crates/cargo-auto) for my automation tasks like `cargo auto build` or `cargo auto doc`, ...

## cargo crev reviews and advisory

We live in times of danger with [supply chain attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supply_chain_attack).  
It is recommended to always use [cargo-crev](https://github.com/crev-dev/cargo-crev)  
to verify the trustworthiness of each of your dependencies.  
Please, spread this info.  
You can also read reviews quickly on the web:
