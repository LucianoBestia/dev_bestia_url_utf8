//! ## Motivation
//!
//! Urls must be constantly encoded and decoded.  
//! It deserves something short like the macro `url!("x/y/{}", name)`.  
//! This module is strictly limited to utf8 urls.  
//! Url is made of parts, fragments or segments mostly delimited by slash "/".  
//! They must be separately encoded/decoded, not as a whole url string.  
//! It is impossible to guarantee that the whole string is correctly encoded/decoded.  
//! But is possible to minimize the misuse of the String type for Url.  
//! With the normal String it is not possible to force the developer to encode/decode.  
//! With special wrapper types around String is possible to help the coder to write properly and not forget about it.  
//! TODO: analyze if is possible to use more &str and Cow instead of always allocating String.  
//! But urls are usually small and this is not a priority.  
//!
//! ## Development
//!
//! I use [cargo-auto](https://crates.io/crates/cargo-auto) for my automation tasks like `cargo auto build` or `cargo auto doc`, ...
//!
//! ## cargo crev reviews and advisory
//!
//! We live in times of danger with [supply chain attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supply_chain_attack).  
//! It is recommended to always use [cargo-crev](https://github.com/crev-dev/cargo-crev)  
//! to verify the trustworthiness of each of your dependencies.  
//! Please, spread this info.  
//! You can also read reviews quickly on the web:  
//! <https://web.crev.dev/rust-reviews/crates/>  
//!
//! ## open-source free and free as a beer
//!
//! My open-source projects are free and free as a beer (MIT license).  
//! I just love programming.  
//! But I need also to drink. If you find my projects and tutorials helpful,  
//! please buy me a beer donating on my [paypal](https://paypal.me/LucianoBestia).  
//! You know the price of a beer in your local bar ;-)  
//! So I can drink a free beer for your health :-)
